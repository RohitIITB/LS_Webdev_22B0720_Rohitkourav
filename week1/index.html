        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that has a long and storied history, originating in England and spreading to become one of the most popular sports worldwide. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of the game, its rules, and gameplay mechanics.</p>
        <h3 style="color: green;">History of Cricket</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Origins</span>: Cricket can be traced back to the 16th century in England, with the first definite reference to the game being played in 1598.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Development</span>: Over the centuries, cricket evolved and became organized with formal rules and structures, leading to the establishment of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1787, which still acts as the guardian of the Laws of Cricket.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">International Expansion</span>: The game spread globally, particularly in British colonies, and today, it's played in over 100 countries with major competitions like the ICC Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, and various domestic leagues.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: green;">Basic Rules and Gameplay Mechanics</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Objective</span>: The main objective of cricket is to score more runs than the opposing team.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Teams</span>: The game is played between two teams of eleven players each.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Pitch</span>: At the center of the field is a 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket at each end, comprising three stumps and two bails.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Innings</span>: Teams take turns to bat and bowl, with one innings per team in limited-overs matches and up to two innings in Test matches.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Overs</span>: An over consists of six legal deliveries bowled by a bowler. In limited-overs cricket, there are typically 20 (T20) or 50 (ODI) overs per side.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Toss</span>: It is a coin flipping that gives winning team the authority to decide whether they want to bowl or bat first.</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: green;">Formats of Cricket</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Test Cricket</span>: The longest format, played over five days with unlimited overs, allowing for two innings per team.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">One Day International (ODI)</span>: Each team faces a maximum of 50 overs, and the match is completed in a single day.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Twenty20 (T20)</span>: A shorter, more explosive format with each team playing a maximum of 20 overs, usually completed in about three hours.</li>
